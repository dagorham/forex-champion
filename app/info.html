<h1>Currency Exchange Data Visualization</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is a basic web application that allows you to plot the exchange rates of various currencies over time. It has support for historical as well as recent daily data. The daily data provides the exchange rate each minute over the past 24 hours. The historical data gives a variety of daily metrics over a user defined period of time. All exchange rates are in USD. The following currencies are supported: </p>

<ul>
<li>Euro (European Union)</li>
<li>Pound (Great Britain)</li>
<li>Peso (Mexico)</li>
<li>Yen (Japan)</li>
<li>Dollar (Australia)</li>
<li>Dollar (Canada)</li>
<li>Rupee (India)</li>
<li>Yuan (China)</li>
<li>Riyal (Saudi Arabia)</li>
<li>Rand (South Africa)</li>
<li>Gold</li>
</ul>


<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>For both historical and daily data, you may plot up to two currencies at any given time. Select the first currency and the second currency using the first two dropdown menus. If you only want to plot one currency, just leave the second menu as "None". Next, choose whether you want daily historical data or just the past 24 hours using the "Data Range" drop down menu.</p>

<p>For 24 hour data, these are the only options. For historical data, you will then need to specify a date range. The available data ranges from 2007/10/05 to yesterday's date. The dates must be input in one of the following formats:</p>

<ul>
<li>YYYY/MM/DD</li>
<li>YYYY-MM-DD</li>
<li>YYYY MM DD</li>
</ul>

<p>If a date box is left blank, or it is entered incorrectly, the date will automatically revert to the minimum or maximum possible value.</p>

<p>The final option for historical data is the data you would like to see. The following options are available:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open Bid/Ask - Price at midnight UTC</li>
<li>Maximum Bid/Ask - Maximum price over the course of the day</li>
<li>Minimum Bid/Ask - Minimum price over the course of the day</li>
<li>Close Bid/Ask - Price at 11:59 PM UTC</li>
</ul>
